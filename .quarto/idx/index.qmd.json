In this course, you will delve into the application of various statistical and probabilistic techniques within the realms of business and economics. Topics include data descriptions and their statistical significance, probability and calculations, counting rules, distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing, inferences, simple linear regression, and most importantly, why and how do we want to use these tools to solve real-world questions. We will ensure a comprehensive understanding and implementation of these techniques.
