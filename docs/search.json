    "text": "General Course Policies\n\nCLASS PREPARATION: Classes are designed to supplement the reading materials (textbooks, course slides, and required readings). Therefore, lectures will not necessarily address the text directly and may not cover all the details in the reading materials. Students must read assigned materials and lecture slides as part of the learning effort. Reading the assigned materials is a good way to cultivate your critical thinking ability and help better follow lectures. Bottom line: Read course slides and required readings.\nPARTICIPATION: Participation in classes is expected for all students, and a lack of participation will impact the grade (see evaluation). Students need to inform the instructor before the class about any anticipated excused absences. See the university attendance guidelines for the definition of excused absences.\nLATE SUBMISSIONS: DO NOT wait until the last minute to submit your assignments as it is always possible to encounter network or computer problems. You do have a grace period of TWO day for late submissions without any penalties, any late work after the grace period won’t be accepted. Please come to my office hour if you need help on lecture, assignments or computer programming.\nWRITING: Professional writing is expected for all assignments, tests, or presentations. You can utilize the writing center if you need assistance. Grammarly and any other similar tools are recommended.\nCOMMUNICATION: Course communication will be done through Canvas and/or email. Be sure to check both regularly for announcements, updates, etc. You are responsible for any content provided. Students need to inform the instructor before the class about any anticipated excused absences. See the university attendance guidelines for the definition of excused absences. Leaving the lecture early without permission is automatically an unexcused absence.\nEMAIL CONVENTIONS: Please put the course name and code in the email subject. Any email without a formal and proper subject may be directed to spam or trash.\nEXAM DATES: Please plan your travel arrangements carefully to avoid conflicts with exam dates. If you have unavoidable commitments that necessitate taking exams on different dates, please inform me well in advance. Note that such accommodations will be considered on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed.",

And 2 pages of letter-sized cheat-sheets are allowed for Exam 3(aka. Final Exam). A calculator is allowed as well.\n\n\nHomework, Quizzes, & Other Activities\nThere will be a few random quizzes, 9 homeworks, and in-class labs in this course. In-class labs are designed to help you learn the material, and you are required to complete them. Homework assignments are posted on Canvas and should be legible, complete, and self-contained. Homework assignments are to be turned in at 11:59 PM on their due dates. You are granted a grace period of two day after the due date without any penalties, but any late submissions after that will not be accepted. If there are extreme circumstances which prevent you from completing the assignment on time, please email me before the due date. Please familiarize yourself with the Canvas system early in the semester. If you are not sure if an assignment has submitted correctly, you may email me with your attached homework as proof that it has been completed by the deadline.\n\n\nIn-Class Participation and Attendance\nThe attendance portion of the grade is made up of several components:\n\nBeing physically present in class.\nNot distracting others while in class. This extends to other students. If your behavior impedes the learning environment of other students, you may be asked to leave the classroom and it will be reflected in your grade.\nCompletion of assigned coursework, including in-class activities, notes submissions and in-class quizzes.\n\nIn-Class Participation is essential for students’ engagement and learning experience. Following University policy, students with 4 or more absences may be dropped from the course before the withdrawal deadline or get an F for the final grade according to the University policies listed under the Course of Study Bulletin or may see their final grade affected.\nIn specific, you will need to complete the following tasks to earn the credits for In-Class Participation/Attendance: - Submit your notes via Canvas at the end of the day of each lecture. The format of the notes doesn’t matter, the submission is counted as your attendance. If you can’t make it to the class due to unavoidable reasons, please do NOT make any submissions.\n\n\nExaminations\nTHREE examinations will be given to evaluate your knowledge of the topics covered in lectures, readings, assignments, as well as the ability to interpret results. Make-up exams will not be offered unless the absence is for a university sanctioned event or the instructors deem that the absence was permissible due to extreme extenuating circumstances.\n\n\nHomework\nIn these 9 homeworks, you will apply what you’ve learned during the lecture and team-work time to complete statistics and probability related tasks. Homeworks are offered via Canvas, 3 attempts are allowed for each homework, and the average of the 3 attempts will be recorded as the final grade of the homework. Please complete the entire homework once you have started an attempt, otherwise, the system may automatically record an ZERO for the unfinished attempt, which could lower your final grade for the homework.\n\n\nDataCamp Practice\nDue to the limited time we are having in class, we won’t be able to cover Python Programming in class. However, since it’s one of the most important and popular programming languages, we will be learning Python through DataCamp.com, which is an online learning platform. Click the link Datacamp to join the classroom DataCamp and complete all the assigned courses by the end of the semester. Each course only takes a couple of hours. Don’t wait until the last day of the semester. I will be available to answer any questions regarding joining the classroom or programming! Happy programming. Python is easy and fun learn.\n\n\nMini-Essays\nStatistics and probability are critical to understanding and solving real-world problems, especially in the fields of business and technology. In this assignment, you will explore how these mathematical、statistical concepts serve as the foundation for modern technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and key business strategies. By connecting theory to practice, the essays will help you understand why studying statistics and probability is essential for success in today’s data-driven world.\nYou will be asked to conduct some research and write 5 mini-essays, each approximately 300 words, focusing on specific topics that illustrate the role of statistics and probability in business and AI technologies. Each essay should highlight key concepts, provide examples, and explain the relevance of statistics and probability in practical applications. No reference/citation and/or essay format requirements. Here are the topics and due dates:\n\nHow TikTok and Instagram Predict What Content You’ll Like?\n\nDue on 01/31/2025.\nInvestigate how social media platforms use statistical analysis and probabilistic models to deliver personalized content recommendations.\n\nHow A/B Testing Enhances Marketing Strategies?\n\nDue on 02/21/2025.\nExplore how businesses use A/B testing, a statistical approach, to optimize marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.\n\nHow Large Language Models (LLMs) Use Statistics and Probability to Generate Natural Language Responses?\n\nDue on 03/14/2025.\nDiscuss the role of statistical techniques and probability theory in enabling LLMs, such as ChatGPT, to produce coherent and context-aware text.\n\nHow Tesla Vehicles Identify People and Objects Using Statistics and Machine Learning\n\nDue on 04/11/2025.\nExamine how Tesla’s autonomous systems apply statistical models and probabilistic reasoning to recognize and classify objects in their environment.\n\nHow Quantitative Traders on Wall Street Make Millions in Seconds?\n\nDue on 05/02/2025.\nAnalyze how quantitative trading relies on statistical algorithms and probability models to execute rapid, data-driven financial transactions.\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation\nTrinity University is committed to providing equal access and equal opportunity to students with disabilities. As a sign of that commitment, the office of Student Accessibility Services (SAS) is to assist students who seek accommodations. Information is available at: https://new.trinity.edu/campuslife/campus-services/student-accessibility-services. Please let me know if you need any assistance as early as possible.\nAccommodated testing can be taken in the Accommodated Testing Center between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on the exam dates. You must utilize the testing center if you want any allotted extra time for your exams. Students are responsible for scheduling their exams with the ATC. Students must take exams at the ATC on or before the scheduled exam dates.\n\n\nSick Policy\nYour health and the well-being of others are also our priorities. If you are experiencing any signs of illness (e.g., fever, nausea, heavy cough, etc.), please do not attend class. Stay home and only return once you are completely symptom-free. If you are unable to attend class due to illness, send me an email as soon as possible to inform me of your situation.\nWhile your health comes first, you are still responsible for completing any required submissions, quizzes, or assignments on time. If your illness impacts your ability to meet deadlines, communicate with me promptly to discuss possible accommodations.\n\n\nAny Grades Boosting Opportunities?\nYes. I drop the TWO lowest homework grades by the end of the semester. And at least TWO extra credit opportunities will be offered throughout the semester. Stay tuned :)",
